# Facial Emotion Recognition

This project focuses on recognizing human facial emotions using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

# Overview
The system identifies facial expressions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and neutral from images or video input.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Machine Learning
- CNN

# What I Learned
- Image preprocessing and feature extraction
- Training and evaluating ML models
- Working with facial datasets
- Applying ML to real-world problems

# Future Improvements
- Improve model accuracy
- Add more emotion classes
- Deploy as a web or mobile application
